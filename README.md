This is my first project using webpack and js modules. I feel particularly proud of this work as I managed to create it from scratch and think my logic out prior to beginning the project. Albeit that was after not thinking it out thoroughly enough hence the 2.0 within the name. The project makes use of local storage and array filtering methods. I particularly enjoyed creating the filter module as it filters all arrays to by task dates, i used date-fns to help with this.
